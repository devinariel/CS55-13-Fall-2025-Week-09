# Creator's Statement

The Therapy Compass was designed with the understanding that finding the right mental health clinician is deeply personal and often overwhelming. Every design decision was made to create a calm, trustworthy space where users can feel confident in their search. The interface features a soothing, earth-toned color palette that feels welcoming rather than clinical, and the layout adapts beautifully whether you're browsing on your phone, tablet, or computer. When you read reviews, you'll notice they're more than just star ratings—they capture the nuanced aspects of care like style match, cultural competence, and accessibility, giving you a fuller picture of what to expect. The application uses artificial intelligence to help you make sense of multiple reviews by summarizing common themes, so you can quickly understand what people are saying without reading through dozens of individual comments. Behind the scenes, the platform ensures your data stays secure and that only verified reviews from real patients are displayed. Most importantly, the entire experience is built around respecting your journey—recognizing that this isn't just another app, but a tool that could help you find the support you need.
